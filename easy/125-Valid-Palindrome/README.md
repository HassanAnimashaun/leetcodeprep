## My Thought Process

### Initial Analysis

- What is the problem asking?
   - return true if the letters forwards reads the same backwards
- What are the constraints?
   - s contains pritable letters
- What's my first intuition?
   - 

### Approach Exploration

1. **Brute Force Approach**

   - Time: O(?)
   - Space: O(?)
   - Why this works but isn't optimal

2. **Optimized Approach**
   - Key insight that led to optimization
   - Time: O(?)
   - Space: O(?)

### Edge Cases Considered

- Empty input
- Single element
- All same elements
- etc.
